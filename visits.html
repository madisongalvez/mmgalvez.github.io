                        At Houston's Helping Paws, we understand
                        the profound impact that interacting with animals can 
                        have on a person's well-being. Our visitation programs 
                        are designed to offer a heartwarming and therapeutic 
                        experience for both potential adopters and individuals 
                        seeking the healing power of animal companionship.

                    including physical disabilities, emotional distress, or psychological 
                    trauma. During these visits, participants have the opportunity to 
                    connect with our gentle and loving cats and dogs.
