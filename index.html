                        Ever since 2023, Houston's Helping Paws (HHP) has been
                        rescuing and rehabilitating animals that have lost their
                        homes, or have been found in need of help. Through our
                        rescue and rehabilitation process, we have been able to
                        give these animals a second chance through adoption,
                        or even through animal therapy and service as well.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each animal has their own personality, and while some
                        may prefer their personal space, many enjoy to serve in
                        animal service and emotional support. Our team aims to
                        not only help animals find a home, but to also help people
                        find their safe space through the comfort of animals. All of
                        our rescues that go out to care for those in need, are ready
                        to be adopted, and are searching for their furr-ever home.
